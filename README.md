# Santa's Little Helper 🎅

You are now the proud owner of the source code for the North Pole's most advanced judgment algorithm. This application uses Google's  Gemini 2.5 models to analyze social media footprints, judge souls, and visualize their rewards (or punishments) in real-time.

## 🎄 How It Works
This is a Serverless Client-Side Application built with React, Vite, and the Google GenAI SDK. It relies entirely on the browser to orchestrate AI agents.

## 🏗️ The Architecture
#### 1. 🧝 The Elves (Data Gathering):
  - News: Uses gemini-2.5-pro with Google Search Grounding to perform a live background check on any public figure.
  - GitHub: Fetches raw user activity via the GitHub REST API to judge code quality and commit habits.
  - Reddit: Attempts direct JSON fetching, falling back to Gemini Research if blocked by CORS.
  - Wikipedia: Scrapes biographical data from the MediaWiki API.
#### 2. 🧠 The Brain (Judgment):
  - Model: gemini-2.5-pro
  - Role: Analyzes the raw text/JSON from the gathering phase. It operates on a strict System Instruction to output a structured JSON verdict including a "Naughty" or "Nice" rating (0-100), a witty persona title, and a rationale in Santa's voice.
#### 3. 🚂 The Toy Shop (Visualization):
  - Model: gemini-2.5-flash-image (Internal Codename: Nano Banana)
  - Role: Takes the visual_prompt generated by The Brain and creates a high-quality, 1:1 aspect ratio image of the specific gift or punishment (e.g., "A lump of coal with a 404 error carved into it").
#### 4. 🎁 The Concierge (Shopping):
  - If a user scores ≥40, The Brain also generates specific real-world gift recommendations, which the UI links directly to Google Shopping.

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Run `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` file (copied from `.env.example`) and add your Gemini `API_KEY`.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the sleigh.

### Note
  - There is a repo-export feature directly in the application given the need to export it from its original Google AI studio environment to allow for local use. Hid the button, but didn't really get rid of anything else. At least Gemini was smart enough to avoid the recursive nature of the export function by not including its own code in the exportable code.
